## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 15 of 20, not the cleanest and I kept getting a vercel app error when trying to hit the endpoints so i just hardcoded a word in to use

## Self-Reflection:
There were other api's I could have used to get words for the game but most of them wanted an account and I did not want to do that and have to add authentication.

### How long it took me to finish this?
2 to 3 hours
